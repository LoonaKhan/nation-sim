# nation-sim

This simulates countries and their performance and international relations over time.
Countries are simulated using concurrency.

Ive always liked simulations, so this is my first major one. 
A number of mechanics are being borrowed from the game, Northgard.

The goal for this game is to make complex countries that can manage themselves and their relations with others.

### TODO:
- countries cna manage themselves
- more aspects to a country
  - trade
  - war
  - happiness
  - other resources

  - [ ]  trade partners
- [ ]  trades or goes to war with others if happiness is low after building up army/economy
