start with a country,
    make a bank, and factory and person
simulate a country's turn
    goroutines
        conveyor belt?
    simulate all of the country's costs and incomes and get the net value
    add/subtract to the bank

country's can manage themselves:
    determine things to invest in, build etc
relations with other countries:
    how to make goroutines interact with eachother
        might need stations to keep things in order



### Country Simulation

- [ ]  country properties
    - [ ]  income (factories?)
    - [ ]  costs
    - [ ]  people
    - [ ]  army
    - [ ]  happiness
    - [ ]  trade partners
- [ ]  concurrency to simulate each of them.
- [ ]  trades or goes to war with others if happiness is low after building up army/economy
    - [ ]  war checker machine?
